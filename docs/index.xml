      <description>This is a place for past and present musical endeavors of mine. Some of these are one off project based samples, others the culmination of months writing and rehearsing, others still have much definition embeded soul searching.

      <description>Introducing the unessential The unnecessary has an interesting place in our lives. Surely we are gluttunous creatures with plenty of excess. Among the hoggish slop of redundance and the encumbering wealth of consumerism is a very specific form of unessential I am calling out here.
A very refined excess that is cultured by nature; culture in-fact is so bound with it, it is defined by and along with this most uneeded of creations.</description>

      <description>The Perfect Guitar Rig I have recently decided to build a new guitar rig. This would include effects pedals selected to sculpt my dream tones, a multi-effects pedal for range in areas I had not prioritized or decide later to explore, an amplifier, amplifier models (usually handled by the multi-effects, however, a surge in cheap easy to program audio chip platforms has made amp modeling a very exciting venue of its own), a guitar, and some gear such as a capo, strings, stands and cases.</description>
